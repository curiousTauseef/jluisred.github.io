Dear Sir, Madam:

I am writing to you because I am interested in knowing about possible research positions at IBM that could match my expertise. Working in such a emblematic company in the computer science domain represents an exciting challenge that I would love to take on. 

Currently, I am facing the last phases of my Phd student period at Eurecom Research Institute, in France. During almost 4 years I have been involved in research activities regarding Semantic Web and Multimedia technologies, Machine Learning algorithms, and Knowledge Representation focusing on the annotation of News Stories. I have also participated in various European projects like LinkedTV, MediaMixer and NexGenTV, with parners from different countries like Germany, The Netherlands or Spain, and attended leading conferences in the domain of Semantic Web and Multimedia. 

During this time I have developed strong communication and adaptation skills. I have dealt with many different cultures and I always enjoy learning about other people's points of view. I am good at listening, understanding the requirements and provide an innovative solutions that place quality first. I love innovating in everything I do, have passion for discovering new things, and enjoy identifying those alternative perspectives of the problem that materialize utopian ideas into today's solutions.  

The work carried out during my Phd has various common points with the research areas you guys are leveraging on at IBM Watson platform, like data mining, knowledge discovery and natural language processing. On the one hand, I have been using different information extraction and machine learning techniques to unveil semantic structures inside unstructured documents, like named entity recognition and disambiguation. On the other hand, I have studied the crucial importance of the context of a document for refining and complementing what is spotted via the aforementioned techniques. My findings in the domain of international news stories have highlighted how only a proper contextualization process, leveraging on the vast knowledge available on the Web, can enable machines to bridge the conceptual gaps between the raw documents and its resulting interpretations.
 
Both the advanced document analysis and the contextualization proceses work in symbiosis to open a window to a more sophisticated, human-like reasoning over the Data, which will ultimately allow to make sense out of it. The Web represents a precious mine of real world objects and shared taxonomies that computers can leverage on via technologies such as Semantic and Big Data.

As for the non-professional part, I am a music enthusiastic and I think of myself as a creative person, which also can be an advantage in an explorative and continuous-learning environment. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any further question. 
Looking forward to hearing from you soon:

Jose Luis
